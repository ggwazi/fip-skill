# FIP Treatment Protocols

Based on research by Dr. Niels C. Pedersen (UC Davis) and ABCD Guidelines

## Overview

GS-441524 is the most effective treatment for FIP, with cure rates >85% when properly administered. This document provides evidence-based protocols for treatment, monitoring, and management.

## Current Treatment Landscape

### Available Antivirals

**GS-441524** (Primary Treatment)

- Most effective antiviral for FIP
- Available forms: Injectable, Oral
- Cure rate: >85% with proper protocol
- Status: Not licensed for veterinary use in most countries

**Alternative Antivirals** (Less Commonly Used)

- GC376 (protease inhibitor)
- Remdesivir (GS-5734, prodrug of GS-441524)
- Molnupiravir (EIDD-2801)

### Legal and Availability Status

**Veterinarian Access:**

- Some countries: Human-licensed, compounded, or regulated formulations
- Others: No legal access

**Client-Sourced Products:**

- Often purchased from unregulated sources
- Variable quality and composition
- Important for veterinarians to support diagnosis and monitoring regardless of drug source
- Maximizes cat welfare even when using non-approved medications

## GS-441524 Treatment Protocols

### Starting Dosages by Disease Form

**Wet or Dry FIP (No Ocular/Neurological Signs)**

- Starting dose: 4-6 mg/kg daily SC
- Duration: 12 weeks minimum
- Younger cats with wet FIP: Lower end of range (4 mg/kg)
- Dry FIP cases: Higher end of range (6 mg/kg)

**Ocular FIP (No Neurological Signs)**

- Starting dose: 8 mg/kg daily SC
- Duration: 12 weeks minimum

**Neurological FIP**

- Starting dose: 10 mg/kg daily SC
- Duration: 12 weeks minimum

**Disease Form Changes During Treatment**

- If wet/dry develops ocular signs → Increase to ocular dosage (8 mg/kg)
- If any form develops neurological signs → Increase to neurological dosage (10 mg/kg)

### Oral vs Injectable Formulations

**Injectable (Preferred)**

- More reliable absorption
- Better for high-dose requirements
- Recommendation: Do NOT use oral forms when dosage >10 mg/kg daily
- Reason: Gut absorption efficiency decreases at high oral concentrations

**Oral (Alternative)**

- May be suitable for lower-dose cases (≤10 mg/kg)
- Less invasive, easier administration
- Variable absorption at higher doses
- Brands include: Aura, Mutian (from Chinese sources)

## Treatment Monitoring Protocol

### Frequency of Monitoring

**Owner Tracking (Daily or Weekly):**

- Temperature
- Weight
- Activity level
- Appetite
- Clinical signs of original disease

**Blood Testing:**

- Baseline: Before treatment starts
- Frequency: Every 4 weeks during treatment
- Minimum tests: CBC and serum chemistry panel

### Critical Monitoring Parameters

**Complete Blood Count (CBC)**

- Hematocrit (PCV)
- Total white blood cell count
- Absolute neutrophil count
- Absolute lymphocyte count

**Serum Chemistry**

- Total protein
- Albumin
- Globulin
- A:G ratio
- Bilirubin (if elevated at diagnosis)

**Optional but Helpful:**

- Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP)
- Serum amyloid A (SAA)

### Graphing Recommendations

Create graphs tracking:

- Weight over time
- Temperature trends
- A:G ratio changes
- Hematocrit values
- Globulin levels

## Dosage Adjustments

### Weight-Based Adjustments

**Weekly Weight Checks:**

- Adjust dosage for weight gain (common in successful treatment)
- Do NOT decrease dose if initial weight loss occurs
- Significant weight gain expected during treatment
- Young/wasted cats may double their body weight during treatment

**Weight Loss Concerns:**

- Failure to gain weight = bad prognostic sign
- May indicate inadequate dosage or treatment failure

### Dosage Increases

**Indications for Increase:**

- Slow improvement in clinical signs
- Blood values not improving adequately
- Poor activity levels
- Failure of original clinical signs to resolve
- Disease form change (adding ocular or neurological signs)
- Partial drug resistance developing

**How to Increase:**

- Increase by +2 to +5 mg/kg daily
- Continue increased dose minimum 4 weeks
- Extend total treatment time to accommodate
- Expect positive response within days to 2 weeks

**Lack of Response to Increase:**

- Dosage still not high enough
- Drug resistance developing
- Drug quality issues
- Misdiagnosis (not FIP)
- Concurrent disease complicating treatment

## Treatment Response Timeline

### Expected Response Patterns

**Early Response (24-72 hours):**

- Temperature normalization
- Improved appetite
- Increased alertness

**Short-term Response (2-4 weeks):**

- Return to normal or near-normal behavior
- Effusion resolution (if present)
- Weight gain beginning
- Clinical signs resolving

**Mid-term Response (8-10 weeks):**

- Critical blood values normalizing
- Unexpected increase in activity levels
- Cat's own immunity developing (believed)
- Most cats destined for cure normalize at this point

**Treatment Completion (12 weeks):**

- Healthy, alert, active cat
- Normal blood test values
- Appropriate weight gain
- Resolution of all clinical signs

### Poor Response Indicators

**Within First Week:**

- No temperature improvement
- No appetite improvement
- Continued lethargy
- Consider alternative diagnoses

**During Treatment:**

- Minimal weight gain
- Blood values not improving
- Persistent clinical signs
- May indicate need for dosage increase

## Treatment Duration

### Standard Protocol

**Minimum Duration: 12 weeks (84 days)**

**Shorter Courses (Select Cases):**

- 42 days documented as effective for some effusive cases
- Evidence-based but less studied
- Must meet all success criteria before stopping

**Extended Treatment:**

- Some cases require >12 weeks
- Indicated when:
  - Dosage increases needed late in treatment
  - Slow response to treatment
  - Blood values not fully normalized at 12 weeks

### Criteria for Stopping Treatment

**Required Indicators (All Must Be Present):**

1. **Outward Signs of Health:**
   - Normal activity level
   - Normal appetite
   - Appropriate weight gain/growth
   - Quality coat (one of best health measures)

2. **Blood Test Normalization:**
   - Hematocrit normal
   - Lymphocyte count normal
   - Total protein normal
   - Albumin normal
   - Globulin normal or near-normal
   - A:G ratio normalized or nearly normalized

3. **Clinical Sign Resolution:**
   - No fever
   - No effusion (if previously present)
   - No neurological signs
   - No ocular inflammation
   - Original disease manifestations resolved

### Decision-Making on Treatment End

**Preponderance of Evidence Approach:**

- Focus on OVERALL health picture
- Do not fixate on single marginally abnormal values
- Outward health manifestations > isolated test abnormalities

**Common Uncertainties:**

- Slightly high globulin with otherwise normal parameters
- Low-normal A:G ratio but excellent clinical health
- Vague ultrasound findings in healthy cat
- Resolution: Trust overall clinical picture

**Avoid Overtreatment:**

- Fear of relapse can drive excessive caution
- Single marginally abnormal values don't mandate extension
- Residual imaging changes may be scarring, not active disease
- Cost and injection site issues with prolonged treatment

## Relapse Management

### Relapse Epidemiology

**When Relapses Occur:**

- Usually during 12-week post-treatment observation period
- Most involve disease escape to CNS or eyes during initial treatment

**High-Risk Forms:**

- Cats initially treated for wet/dry FIP at lower doses
- Insufficient dose to overcome blood-brain or blood-eye barriers
- Neurological relapses more common than ocular

**Blood-Barrier Effectiveness:**

- Blood-brain barrier most restrictive
- Blood-eye barrier less restrictive
- Eye lesions more easily cured than brain/spine infections

### Relapse Treatment Protocol

**Starting Dosage:**

- Minimum: Previous dose + 5 mg/kg daily
- Example: If relapsed after 6 mg/kg → Restart at 11 mg/kg minimum
- Higher doses for neurological involvement (12-15 mg/kg)

**Duration:**

- Minimum: 8 weeks
- May require longer based on response

**Drug Form:**

- Do NOT use oral GS-441524 if dose >10 mg/kg
- Reduced gut absorption at high concentrations
- Injectable form required

### Relapse Outcomes

**Successful Retreatment:**

- Many cats can be successfully retreated
- May require higher doses and longer duration
- Close monitoring essential

**Partial Response:**

- Some neurological damage may be permanent
- Peripheral nerve damage may slowly regenerate
- CNS damage typically does NOT regenerate
- Paralysis and leg weakness often permanent if CNS-related

**Treatment Failure:**

- Progressive drug resistance
- Some cats controllable but not curable
- May require continuous treatment
- Eventually resistance worsens or financial limits reached

## Drug Resistance

### Types of Resistance

**Partial Resistance:**

- Develops during treatment
- Requires higher dosing to control
- May allow disease control but not cure
- Clinical signs recur when treatment stopped

**Complete Resistance:**

- Disease progression despite treatment
- Variable severity of clinical signs
- Treatment ineffective even at high doses

### Risk Factors for Resistance

**Highest Risk:**

- Neurological FIP at presentation
- Development of brain infection during treatment
- Relapse involving CNS
- Inadequate initial dosing

**Lower Risk:**

- Wet FIP in young cats
- Prompt treatment initiation
- Adequate dosing from start

### Managing Resistance

**Dosage Escalation:**

- Increase by 2-5 mg/kg increments
- Maximum attempted doses: 15 mg/kg daily
- Beyond 15 mg/kg rarely successful

**Alternative Strategies (Experimental):**

- Adding GC376 (protease inhibitor) to GS-441524
- Combination therapy may overcome resistance
- Evidence limited, research ongoing

**Euthanasia Considerations:**

- Some cats cannot be cured despite maximum efforts
- Continuous treatment without cure: quality of life assessment
- Financial constraints: ethical consideration
- Progressive resistance with suffering: humane euthanasia

## Supportive Care

### Essential Supportive Measures

**Nutritional Support:**

- Appetite stimulants if needed (prednisolone short-term, Entyce)
- High-quality nutrition
- Calorie supplementation for wasted cats
- Feeding tubes if necessary (last resort)

**Fluid Therapy:**

- Indicated for dehydration
- Subcutaneous or IV depending on severity
- Monitor hydration status

**Effusion Drainage:**

- **Only if affecting breathing**
- Thoracocentesis for dyspnea
- Do NOT routinely drain abdominal effusion
- Effusion typically resolves with antiviral treatment

**Pain Management:**

- Analgesics as needed
- Gabapentin for injection pain
- Multimodal pain management

**Pyrexia Management:**

- Monitor temperature
- Antipyretics if needed (with caution)
- Short-term prednisolone permissible

**Anti-emetics:**

- As needed for nausea/vomiting
- Maropitant, ondansetron options

### Corticosteroids

**Acceptable Short-term Use:**

- Appetite stimulation (few days)
- Severe inflammation (limited duration)
- Do NOT use long-term
- No proven benefit for FIP treatment

**Contraindications for Long-term Use:**

- Immunosuppression contraindicated in viral disease
- No evidence of benefit
- May interfere with immune response development

### Supplements and Adjuncts

**Not Recommended (No Proven Benefit):**

- Liver tonics (SAMe, milk thistle, silymarin)
- Vitamin supplements (beyond basic nutrition)
- Probiotics
- Vitamin B3, S-Adenosylmethionine
- Interferon omega
- Polyprenyl immunostimulant (PPI)
- Non-specific immunostimulants

**Evidence:**

- No controlled studies showing benefit
- Added cost without proven value
- Focus resources on proven antiviral therapy

## Injection Site Management

### Pain Management

**Pre-injection:**

- Gabapentin 1-2 hours before injection
- Dose: 5-10 mg/kg PO
- Reduces pain and anxiety

**Injection Technique:**

- Rotate injection sites systematically
- Stay away from between shoulders
- Target sites:
  - 1 inch behind shoulder blades
  - Down back to 1-2 inches before tail
  - One-third to one-half down chest and abdomen
- Inject into subcutaneous tissue (NOT muscle/nerve layers)

### Injection Site Reactions

**Prevention:**

- Proper site rotation
- Correct injection depth
- Good technique

**Management of Sores:**

- Clear surrounding hair
- Gentle cleaning 4+ times daily
- Use sterile cotton balls
- 1:5 dilution of household hydrogen peroxide
- Usually heal within 2 weeks
- Typically no additional treatment needed

**Severe Reactions:**

- Rare vasculitis-type reactions
- Occur at non-injection sites
- Often self-limiting
- May respond to short-term low-dose steroids

### Systemic Side Effects

**Renal Effects:**

- Minor kidney value elevation possible
- Non-progressive
- Does not lead to clinical renal disease
- Monitor BUN/creatinine

**Hepatic Effects:**

- No apparent liver toxicity with GS-441524
- (Note: Remdesivir may show mild liver effects in humans)

**Other Side Effects:**

- Remarkably few systemic effects
- Well-tolerated overall
- Main issue is injection site pain/reactions

## Treatment Modifications (Not Recommended)

### Unproven Modifications

Several treatment groups use modifications lacking evidence:

**Very High Starting Doses:**

- Starting at maximum dose from onset
- No evidence of improved outcomes
- Increased cost and side effect risk

**"Capping" Treatment:**

- Extra high dose in last 2 weeks
- No evidence reduces relapse rates
- No proven benefit

**Additional Drugs:**

- Interferon omega supplementation
- Non-specific immunostimulants
- No proven synergistic effect

**Multiple Supplements:**

- Tonics, vitamins, B12 injections
- Rarely necessary in pure FIP
- Added cost without benefit

### Experimental Combinations

**GC376 + GS-441524:**

- Adding protease inhibitor to overcome resistance
- Mechanism: Works downstream from GS-441524
- Evidence: Limited, research ongoing
- May be helpful for resistance cases
- Not synergistic for standard treatment

## Prognostic Factors

### Favorable Prognosis

**Age:**

- Young cats (<7 years): Better outcomes
- Kittens: Highest cure rates

**Disease Form:**

- Wet FIP: Better response than dry
- No neurological involvement: Better prognosis
- No ocular involvement: Better prognosis

**Timing:**

- Early treatment initiation: Better outcomes
- Less advanced disease: Higher cure rates

**Treatment Response:**

- Rapid initial response (24-72h): Good sign
- Significant weight gain: Excellent sign
- Quick blood value normalization: Good prognosis

### Poor Prognosis

**Age:**

- Cats >7 years: Lower cure rates
- Geriatric cats: Poorest outcomes

**Disease Form:**

- Neurological FIP: Most difficult to cure
- Pre-existing CNS damage: Permanent deficits
- Combined forms: More challenging

**Resistance:**

- Partial resistance: Controllable but may not cure
- Complete resistance: Very poor prognosis

**Late Presentation:**

- Advanced disease: Lower cure rates
- Severe wasting: Poorer outcomes
- Multi-organ involvement: More challenging

## Future Treatments

### Remdesivir

**Current Status:**

- FDA-approved for human COVID-19
- Prodrug converted to GS-441524 in body
- May become available for veterinary use

**Considerations:**

- Molecular weight: 1.5x GS-441524
- Requires 1.5 mg remdesivir to yield 1 mg GS-441524
- Different diluent (designed for IV use)
- Unknown behavior with SC injection over 12 weeks

**Potential Issues:**

- Human trials showed mild liver/kidney toxicity
- Unknown if due to GS-441524 or additives
- Long-term SC use in cats not studied

### GC376/GC373

**Status:**

- Anivive Lifesciences has licensing
- Still 2+ years from approval (as of documentation date)
- Protease inhibitor (different mechanism than GS-441524)

**Expected Role:**

- Combination therapy to prevent resistance
- Similar to HIV/AIDS combination antivirals
- Not likely superior as monotherapy

### Other Antivirals

**3CLpro Inhibitors:**

- Pfizer has compounds in human trials
- May become available for veterinary use
- Competition may reduce costs

**Molnupiravir (MK-4482/EIDD-2801):**

- Human trials showed limited efficacy
- Unlikely to be pursued for FIP
