# FIP Diagnostic Flowcharts

Based on ABCD (European Advisory Board on Cat Diseases) Guidelines, November 2024

## Overview

FIP diagnosis requires a weight-of-evidence approach combining signalment, history, clinical examination,
laboratory findings, and confirmatory testing. This document provides diagnostic decision trees for four
clinical presentations.

## Evidence Weighting System

- `++++` = extremely likely FIP
- `+++` = far more likely FIP  
- `++` = moderately more likely FIP
- `+` = slightly more likely FIP
- `-` = slightly less likely FIP
- `--` = moderately less likely FIP
- `---` = far less likely FIP
- `----` = extremely unlikely FIP

## Diagnostic Tree A: Effusion Present

**Use when:** Effusion cytology & biochemistry consistent with FIP

### Pathway

1. **Effusion Sample Analysis**
   - Perform FCoV RT-PCR and/or immunostaining for FCoV antigen

2. **If either test positive:**
   - **Positive FCoV RT-PCR with high RNA loads AND/OR**
   - **Positive immunostaining for FCoV antigen**
   - → **FIP very likely¹**

3. **If negative:**
   - → **FIP less likely**
   - If still suspicious: Take FNAs of accessible abnormal organs
   - (e.g., mesenteric lymph node, kidney, liver, spleen)
   - Test for cytology, FCoV RT-PCR, and/or immunostaining

4. **If FNA results positive:**
   - → **FIP very likely¹**

5. **If FNA results negative/not consistent:**
   - If still suspicious: Consider laparotomy/laparoscopy/trucut
   - Biopsy for histopathology & immunohistochemistry

6. **Final Confirmation:**
   - Histopathology consistent + positive immunohistochemistry → **Confirms FIP**
   - Histopathology not consistent + negative immunohistochemistry → **FIP very unlikely**

¹Some authors regard positive immunostaining on effusion (with consistent biochemistry & cytology) adequate to confirm FIP

### Laboratory Contact Note

When submitting fluid or FNA samples for FCoV antigen immunostaining:

- Contact laboratory first for preferred sample preparation methods
- Some labs prefer cell pellets prepared from fluid samples

## Diagnostic Tree B: No Effusion + Non-specific Signs

**Use when:** Absence of effusion (by POCUS) & presence of non-specific clinical signs

### Pathway

1. **Perform Diagnostic Imaging**

   **Ultrasonography findings consistent with FIP:**
   - Abdominal lymphadenopathy
   - Liver abnormalities (variable echogenicity)
   - Spleen abnormalities (variable echogenicity)
   - Kidney abnormalities (variable echogenicity, medullary rim sign)

   **Radiography findings:**
   - Lymphadenopathy
   - Alveolar pattern

2. **FNAs of Accessible Abnormal Organs/Tissue**
   - Target: mesenteric lymph node with consistent cytology (neutrophilic/pyogranulomatous)
   - Perform FCoV RT-PCR and/or immunostaining for FCoV antigen

3. **If either positive:**
   - **Positive FCoV RT-PCR with high RNA loads AND/OR**
   - **Positive immunostaining with consistent cytology**
   - → **FIP very likely¹**

4. **If negative:**
   - → **FIP less likely**
   - If still suspicious: Continue monitoring
   - Abnormalities can develop over time
   - Sample via body cavity centesis, FNA, trucut, or full biopsy when possible

5. **If later samples positive:**
   - → **FIP very likely¹**

6. **Final Confirmation:**
   - Histopathology consistent + positive immunohistochemistry → **Confirms FIP**
   - Not consistent/negative → **FIP very unlikely**

### Important Note

In absence of obvious localizing signs or abnormalities:

- Ultrasonography indicated to evaluate abdominal & thoracic organs
- Remember effusions can develop over time
- Sequential imaging may reveal new fluid pockets

## Diagnostic Tree C: Neurological Findings

**Use when:** Neurological findings consistent with FIP

### Advanced Imaging Findings

**MRI findings suggestive of FIP:**

- Obstructive hydrocephalus
- Syringomyelia
- Foramen magnum herniation
- Marked contrast enhancement of:
  - Meninges
  - Third ventricle
  - Mesencephalic aqueduct
  - Brainstem

**CT findings:**

- Hydrocephalus
- Syringohydromyelia

**CSF findings suggestive of FIP:**

- High protein (>0.3 g/L cisternal; >0.46 g/L lumbar)
- High cell count (>0.008 x10⁹/L)
- Cytology: predominantly neutrophilic, mononuclear, mixed, or pyogranulomatous

### Pathway

1. **CSF Sample Analysis**
   - Perform FCoV RT-PCR and/or immunostaining for FCoV antigen

2. **If either positive:**
   - **Positive FCoV RT-PCR with high RNA loads AND/OR**
   - **Positive immunostaining**
   - → **FIP very likely¹**

3. **If negative:**
   - → **FIP less likely**
   - If still suspicious: Monitor for non-neurological changes
   - Sample via body cavity centesis, FNA, trucut, or biopsy when possible

4. **If later samples positive with consistent cytology:**
   - → **FIP very likely¹**

5. **Final Confirmation:**
   - Histopathology consistent + positive immunohistochemistry → **Confirms FIP**
   - Not consistent/negative → **FIP very unlikely**

### Critical Note

**Always look for signs of disease elsewhere** (chest & abdomen via ultrasonography) in cats with
neurological signs. These areas can be easier and more cost-effective to sample compared to CT, MRI,
CSF collection.

### Advanced Imaging Requirements

In absence of non-neurological signs or abnormalities:

- Advanced imaging via CT or preferably MRI is indicated
- Allows evaluation for neurological system abnormalities
- Assesses potential risk of herniation before CSF collection
- Referral may be needed if veterinarian unfamiliar with neurological investigations

## Diagnostic Tree D: Ocular Findings

**Use when:** Ocular findings consistent with FIP

### Pathway

1. **Aqueous Humour Sample Analysis**
   - Collect aqueous humour sample
   - Assess cytology (should be consistent: neutrophilic or pyogranulomatous)
   - Perform FCoV RT-PCR and/or immunostaining for FCoV antigen

2. **If either positive:**
   - **Positive FCoV RT-PCR with high RNA loads AND/OR**
   - **Positive immunostaining with consistent cytology**
   - → **FIP very likely¹**

3. **If negative:**
   - → **FIP less likely**
   - If still suspicious: Monitor for non-ocular changes
   - Sample when abnormalities develop (body cavity centesis, FNA, trucut, biopsy)
   - If enucleation performed for severe uveitis/glaucoma, submit eye for histopathology & immunohistochemistry

4. **If later samples positive with consistent cytology:**
   - → **FIP very likely¹**

5. **Final Confirmation:**
   - Histopathology consistent + positive immunohistochemistry → **Confirms FIP**
   - Not consistent/negative → **FIP very unlikely**

### Important Notes

**Sample Collection:**

- Aqueous humour sampling may require referral if veterinarian unfamiliar with ophthalmological investigations

**Alternative Sampling:**
Always look for signs of disease elsewhere (chest & abdomen via ultrasonography) in cats with ocular signs.
These areas can be easier and more cost-effective to sample than aqueous humour.

## Treatment Trial Considerations

As effective antiviral treatments (especially GS-441524) are increasingly available, a treatment trial can be instigated if FIP is thought to be **very likely**.

### Treatment Trial Protocol

**Before Starting:**

- Ideally, collect appropriate samples for FCoV detection
- Submit for testing to confirm diagnosis or show "very likely"

**During Treatment:**

- Use objective measures to monitor response:
  - Weight
  - Temperature
  - A:G ratio
  
**Response Assessment:**

- If cat does NOT respond rapidly (within 1 week) to trial treatment using antiviral of known quality
- Important to consider other diagnoses (see differential diagnoses)

### Treatment Response Criteria

**Positive Response Indicators:**

- Rapid improvement in clinical signs (within 1 week)
- Temperature normalization
- Weight gain
- Improved activity level
- Effusion resolution (if present)

**Poor Response Indicators:**

- No improvement in clinical signs within 1 week
- Persistent fever
- Continued weight loss
- No change in A:G ratio
- Consider alternative diagnoses

## Confirmatory Testing Summary

### Gold Standard

**Histopathology + Immunohistochemistry**

- Histopathology consistent with FIP
- Positive immunohistochemistry for FCoV antigen in lesions
- → **Confirms FIP**

### Very Likely Diagnosis¹

Any of the following with appropriate clinical context:

- Positive immunostaining for FCoV antigen in effusion (with consistent biochemistry & cytology)
- Positive FCoV RT-PCR with high viral loads in effusion
- Positive immunostaining for FCoV antigen in FNA (with consistent cytology)
- Positive FCoV RT-PCR with high viral loads in FNA
- Positive immunostaining in CSF (with consistent cytology)
- Positive immunostaining in aqueous humour (with consistent cytology)

¹Note: Some authorities consider positive immunostaining on effusion with consistent biochemistry and cytology adequate to confirm FIP

## Key Diagnostic Principles

1. **FIP diagnosis is made on preponderance of evidence** - no single test confirms or rules out FIP in isolation

2. **Serum FCoV antibodies are NOT diagnostic** - they only indicate previous FCoV exposure

3. **High FCoV viral loads in appropriate samples** strongly support FIP diagnosis

4. **Immunostaining is more specific than PCR** for confirming FIP

5. **Clinical response to treatment** can support diagnosis but other confirmation methods preferred

6. **Monitor for changes over time** - abnormalities can develop that allow sampling

7. **Consider sampling more accessible sites** before pursuing advanced procedures (CSF, aqueous humour)

## Common Diagnostic Pitfalls

1. **Relying solely on antibody titers** - not diagnostic of FIP
2. **Accepting low viral loads as confirmatory** - need high loads for confidence
3. **Ignoring clinical context** - test results must align with clinical picture
4. **Not following diagnostic trees systematically** - missing key decision points
5. **Premature closure** - stopping investigation too early in dry form cases
