# FIP Prevention and Cattery Management

## Overview

Evidence-based strategies for reducing FIP risk in multi-cat environments, catteries, and shelters.

## Prevention Strategies

### Environmental Management

**Litter Box Protocol:**

- Minimum: 1 box per cat + 1 extra
- Clean twice daily minimum
- Use clumping litter (easier to remove contaminated material)
- Place in well-ventilated areas
- Separate from food/water areas

**Hygiene Practices:**

- Daily disinfection of high-touch surfaces
- Weekly deep cleaning
- Use coronavirus-effective disinfectants:
  - Diluted bleach (1:32 dilution)
  - Accelerated hydrogen peroxide
  - Steam cleaning (>60°C)

**Space Requirements:**

- Minimum 18 sq ft per cat for indoor spaces
- Vertical space counts (cat trees, shelves)
- Separate areas for eating, sleeping, toileting

### Population Management

**Optimal Group Size:**

- Ideal: ≤3 cats per household
- Maximum recommended: 5-6 cats
- Risk increases substantially with >6 cats
- Consider separate groups if >6 cats necessary

**Stress Reduction:**

- Stable groups (avoid frequent additions/removals)
- Minimize competition for resources
- Provide hiding spots and escape routes
- Reduce household disruptions
- Pheromone diffusers may help

**Quarantine Protocols:**

- New arrivals: 2-week isolation minimum
- Test for FCoV shedding before integration
- Monitor for clinical signs
- Gradual introduction process

### Breeding Cattery Considerations

**Pre-Breeding Testing:**

- Test queens and studs for FCoV shedding
- Separate shedders from non-shedders if feasible
- Consider breeding only from non-shedding lines

**Kitten Management:**

- Early weaning (5-6 weeks) may reduce transmission
- Separate kittens from adults early
- Individual housing for kittens if possible
- Do NOT use GS-441524 prophylactically (resistance risk)

**When FIP Occurs in Cattery:**

- Pause breeding temporarily
- Identify and isolate shedders
- Enhance environmental hygiene
- Consider genetic factors (some lines higher risk)
- Do NOT cull entire cattery (most cats will not develop FIP)

### Shelter Management

**Intake Protocols:**

- Separate housing for new arrivals
- Minimize stress during transition
- Rapid adoption to reduce crowding
- Consider foster programs

**Housing Strategy:**

- Small stable groups
- Avoid mixing cats from different sources
- Provide enrichment to reduce stress
- Prompt medical attention for illness

**Adoption Considerations:**

- Educate adopters about FIP risk
- Higher risk in multi-cat adoptions
- Recommend 2-week isolation if adding to existing household
- Provide post-adoption support

## FCoV Testing in Multi-Cat Environments

### When to Test

**Cattery Scenarios:**

- Before breeding
- When FIP case occurs
- When separating shedders from non-shedders
- Annual screening recommended

**Household Scenarios:**

- Generally not recommended for stable pet households
- Consider if adding new cat to known FCoV-negative group
- If FIP occurs and other cats need evaluation

### Testing Methods

**Fecal RT-PCR:**

- Most practical for detecting shedders
- Collect feces (litter-free) or rectal swab
- Test 3 samples over 1-2 weeks (intermittent shedding)
- Positive = actively shedding FCoV
- Negative = not shedding at time of test (but may shed later)

**Serology (Antibody Testing):**

- Indicates exposure, not active infection
- Does NOT predict FIP risk
- Not useful for management decisions
- Not recommended for routine testing

### Interpreting Results

**Positive Fecal PCR:**

- Cat is shedding FCoV in feces
- Transmission risk to other cats
- Does NOT mean cat will develop FIP
- Consider isolation if feasible

**Negative Fecal PCR:**

- Not shedding at time of test
- May become shedder later
- Requires repeated testing to confirm
- Best for introducing to FCoV-negative groups

**Management Based on Testing:**

- Separate shedders from non-shedders if possible
- Not always practical in households
- More feasible in catteries
- Focus on hygiene regardless of status

## Vaccination

### Available Vaccine: Felocell FIP

**Product Details:**

- Intranasal modified live virus vaccine
- Temperature-sensitive strain
- Minimum age: 16 weeks

**ABCD Position:**

- Not recommended by ABCD
- Efficacy controversial
- Most cats already exposed before vaccine age
- Does not work in previously infected cats

**When Might Be Considered:**

- Kittens in FCoV-negative household
- Before 16 weeks exposure risk
- Known FCoV-negative status
- Limited evidence of benefit

**Why Not Recommended:**

- Most kittens exposed <16 weeks
- Vaccine ineffective after FCoV exposure
- Evidence of efficacy limited
- Better to focus on environmental management

## Genetic Considerations

### Breed Predispositions

**Higher Risk Breeds:**

- Pedigree cats in general at higher risk than mixed breed
- Specific breeds vary by geographic region
- May reflect breeding practices more than genetics
- Inbreeding increases risk

**Family Lines:**

- Siblings of FIP cases at higher risk
- Some family lines show multiple cases
- Genetic susceptibility likely
- Consider this in breeding decisions

### Reducing Genetic Risk

**Breeding Strategies:**

- Avoid breeding cats with FIP in close relatives
- Maintain genetic diversity
- Avoid excessive inbreeding
- Track FIP cases in pedigree lines

**Not Recommended:**

- Culling entire lines (most cats will never develop FIP)
- Refusing to breed any cat with FIP relative
- Extreme measures (low risk in general population)

## What NOT to Do

### Ineffective or Harmful Practices

**Do NOT:**

- Use GS-441524 or other antivirals as prophylaxis (creates resistance)
- Cull all cats in household/cattery after FIP case
- Rely on antibody testing for management decisions
- Isolate FIP+ cat from stable long-term household
- Test and retest endlessly (intermittent shedding normal)
- Assume all cats in environment will develop FIP (most won't)

**Why These Don't Work:**

- Prophylactic antivirals: Drive resistance without proven benefit
- Culling: Most cats don't develop FIP; unnecessary
- Antibody testing: Doesn't predict FIP; not actionable
- Isolation: Stressful; most exposed already; not transmitted easily
- Excessive testing: Anxiety-inducing; doesn't change management
- Excessive worry: FIP mutation rare even in exposed cats

## Risk Assessment Tool

### Low Risk Environment

- 1-3 cats
- Stable group (no additions/removals)
- Good hygiene
- Low stress
- Indoor only

**Action:** Basic hygiene, monitor for illness

### Moderate Risk Environment

- 4-6 cats
- Occasional additions
- Multi-cat household
- Some stressors present

**Action:** Enhanced hygiene, stress reduction, consider testing new arrivals

### High Risk Environment

- >6 cats
- Frequent additions/removals (shelter, cattery)
- High density housing
- Multiple stressors

**Action:** Rigorous hygiene protocols, population management, FCoV testing program, rapid isolation of ill cats

## Special Scenarios

### After FIP Diagnosis in Household

**Immediate Actions:**

- Do NOT isolate the sick cat (unless for treatment convenience)
- Other cats likely already exposed to FCoV
- Focus on stress reduction for all cats
- Monitor others for clinical signs

**Long-term:**

- No need to test other cats routinely
- Watch for similar signs
- Maintain good hygiene
- Avoid adding new cats during illness/treatment

**When to Worry About Other Cats:**

- Siblings of FIP cat (highest risk)
- Young cats (<2 years)
- Recent stress events
- Development of FIP signs

### Adding New Cat to Household

**Before Addition:**

- Consider testing new cat for FCoV shedding
- 2-week quarantine minimum
- Monitor for illness during quarantine
- Gradual introduction to reduce stress

**After Addition:**

- Minimize stress during integration
- Provide adequate resources
- Monitor all cats for illness
- Accept that FCoV transmission likely if resident cats are shedders

### Moving/Rehoming Cats

**Stress Management:**

- Major stressor for FIP development
- If possible, delay if cat recently exposed to FCoV
- Pheromone therapy
- Maintain routines as much as possible
- Allow adjustment time in new environment

**Risk Period:**

- Highest risk 2-8 weeks after major stress
- Monitor closely during this period
- Seek veterinary care promptly if signs develop

## Key Principles

1. **Focus on stress reduction** - Most important prevention factor

2. **Hygiene matters** - Reduce viral load in environment

3. **Smaller is better** - Keep groups small and stable

4. **Most cats never develop FIP** - Even when exposed to FCoV

5. **Testing has limitations** - FCoV PCR shows shedding at one point in time; antibodies show exposure only

6. **Vaccination not generally recommended** - Focus on environmental management instead

7. **Don't use antivirals prophylactically** - Creates resistance without proven benefit

8. **Support immunity naturally** - Good nutrition, low stress, appropriate veterinary care

## Summary Guidelines

### For Pet Owners

- Keep groups small (≤3 cats ideal)
- Excellent litter box hygiene
- Minimize stress
- Prompt veterinary care for illness
- Don't obsess over prevention (most cats fine)

### For Catteries

- Test breeding stock for FCoV shedding
- Separate shedders from non-shedders if feasible
- Early kitten weaning and separation
- Pause breeding after FIP case
- Maintain genetic diversity

### For Shelters

- Rapid adoption programs
- Small stable groups
- Enhanced hygiene
- Enrichment to reduce stress
- Foster programs when possible

## When Prevention Fails

If FIP develops despite prevention efforts:

1. **Not your fault** - Mutation is random, not fully preventable
2. **Treatment available** - GS-441524 >85% cure rate
3. **Other cats likely okay** - Most won't develop FIP
4. **Focus on the sick cat** - Prompt diagnosis and treatment
5. **Don't panic** - This is treatable now

## Resources and References

Based on:

- ABCD FIP Guidelines 2024
- Feline coronavirus epidemiology studies
- Cattery management research
- Shelter medicine best practices

---

**Bottom Line:** Focus on stress reduction and hygiene. Most cats exposed to FCoV never develop FIP. When FIP does occur, treatment is now available with high success rates.
