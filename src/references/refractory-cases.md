> **Purpose:** Evidence-based guidance for treatment failures and non-responders
> **Audience:** Veterinarians managing challenging FIP cases
> **Evidence Base:** UC Davis research, published case series, ABCD Guidelines 2024

---

## Overview

While GS-441524 treatment achieves cure rates of 85%+ in wet FIP and 70-75% in dry FIP, a subset of cats fail to respond or respond initially then relapse. This document provides systematic approaches to managing these refractory cases.

**Definition of Treatment Failure:**
- No clinical improvement after 2-4 weeks of appropriate dosing
- Initial improvement followed by clinical deterioration while on treatment
- Relapse within 12 weeks of completing treatment course
- Progressive disease despite dose escalation

---

## Categories of Treatment Failure

### 1. Primary Non-Response
**Definition:** No improvement within 2-4 weeks of initiating treatment at appropriate doses

**Estimated Incidence:** 10-20% of treated cats

**Clinical Presentation:**
- Persistent fever
- Continued weight loss
- No improvement in appetite or energy
- Worsening effusions (wet FIP)
- Progressive organ dysfunction (dry FIP)
- Declining bloodwork parameters (continued elevation of globulins, declining A:G ratio)

### 2. Secondary Non-Response
**Definition:** Initial improvement (1-4 weeks) followed by plateau or deterioration despite continued treatment

**Estimated Incidence:** 5-10% of treated cats

**Clinical Presentation:**
- Initial fever resolution then return
- Weight gain that plateaus or reverses
- Re-accumulation of fluid after initial decrease
- Bloodwork improves then worsens

### 3. Relapse During Treatment
**Definition:** Clinical deterioration while on active treatment after initial good response

**Estimated Incidence:** 5-10% during treatment

**Clinical Presentation:**
- Return of fever
- Appetite decrease
- Lethargy
- Re-accumulation of effusion
- Neurological signs worsening

### 4. Post-Treatment Relapse
**Definition:** Disease recurrence after completing full treatment course

**Estimated Incidence:** 5-10% within first year post-treatment

**Clinical Presentation:**
- Recurrence of original symptoms
- May present differently than initial disease
- Usually occurs within 3-6 months of stopping treatment
- Can occur up to 12+ months later (rare)

---

## Diagnostic Approach to Treatment Failure

### Step 1: Verify FIP Diagnosis

**Consider alternative diagnoses:**

- **Lymphoma** (especially if neurological or ocular involvement)
  - Cytology/biopsy of affected tissues
  - FeLV/FIV testing
  - Advanced imaging

- **Toxoplasmosis** (neurological cases)
  - Toxoplasma serology (IgM and IgG)
  - PCR on CSF if available
  - Response to trial therapy

- **Cryptococcosis** (neurological/ocular cases)
  - Cryptococcal antigen test
  - CSF analysis
  - Imaging findings

- **FeLV-associated disease**
  - FeLV testing (antigen and PCR)
  - Bone marrow evaluation

- **Chronic inflammatory conditions**
  - Inflammatory bowel disease
  - Cholangitis
  - Pancreatitis

**Confirmatory testing for FIP:**
- RT-PCR on effusion (if present) - very high sensitivity/specificity
- Immunohistochemistry on biopsy samples (gold standard if obtainable)
- Re-evaluation of initial diagnostic criteria

### Step 2: Assess Treatment Adequacy

**Dosing verification:**

- **Calculate dose based on current weight**
  - Wet/dry FIP: 4-6 mg/kg
  - Ocular FIP: 8-10 mg/kg
  - Neurological FIP: 10-12 mg/kg

- **Verify actual dose received:**
  - Check owner's technique and measuring
  - Observe injection/oral administration
  - Calculate cumulative dose over time

- **Account for weight gain:**
  - Cats gaining weight need dose adjustments
  - Failure to increase dose is common cause of "treatment failure"

**Medication quality assessment:**

- **Source verification:**
  - Compounding pharmacy reputation
  - Batch testing if available
  - Consistency of formulation

- **Storage and handling:**
  - Proper refrigeration maintained?
  - Medication expired?
  - Light exposure (degrades medication)?

- **Consider switching sources** if quality questionable

**Bioavailability considerations:**

- **Oral vs. injectable:**
  - Oral bioavailability lower (especially with food)
  - Injectable more reliable for severe cases
  - Consider switching if using oral

- **Gastrointestinal absorption:**
  - Vomiting or diarrhea affecting absorption?
  - Inflammatory bowel disease present?
  - Consider injectable if GI issues

### Step 3: Identify Complicating Factors

**Concurrent diseases:**

- **FeLV/FIV co-infection**
  - Test if not already done
  - Significantly worsens prognosis
  - May require different approach

- **Bacterial infections:**
  - Secondary to FIP-related immunosuppression
  - Culture effusions if present
  - Consider empirical antibiotic trial

- **Organ failure:**
  - Severe hepatic dysfunction
  - Renal failure
  - May limit recovery potential

**Compliance issues:**

- **Missed doses:**
  - Careful history taking
  - Treatment log review
  - Client honesty (create non-judgmental environment)

- **Administration difficulties:**
  - Cat avoiding owner
  - Injection site reactions limiting options
  - Client technique problems

- **Financial constraints:**
  - Underdosing to extend medication
  - Inconsistent treatment
  - Premature discontinuation

## Management Strategies for Refractory Cases

### Protocol 1: Dose Escalation

**Indications:**
- Partial response but incomplete
- Plateau in improvement
- Adequate compliance verified
- No severe organ dysfunction

**Approach:**

1. **Increase dose by 25-50%:**
   - Standard dose: 6 mg/kg → escalate to 8-9 mg/kg
   - Neurological dose: 10 mg/kg → escalate to 12-15 mg/kg

2. **Monitor closely:**
   - Weekly weight and clinical assessment
   - Bloodwork every 2 weeks during escalation
   - Watch for adverse effects

3. **Re-evaluate after 2-3 weeks:**
   - If improving: continue elevated dose
   - If no change: consider further escalation or alternative approaches
   - If worsening: reconsider diagnosis

**Evidence:**
- Case reports of successful treatment with doses up to 20 mg/kg
- Higher doses associated with increased side effects
- Balance efficacy vs. tolerability

**Maximum recommended doses:**
- Wet/dry FIP: 10-12 mg/kg
- Neurological FIP: 15-20 mg/kg
- Monitor liver enzymes closely at high doses

### Protocol 2: Switch Formulation

**Indications:**
- Oral medication with suboptimal response
- Suspected bioavailability issues
- GI symptoms affecting absorption

**Options:**

1. **Oral to injectable:**
   - More reliable absorption
   - Higher bioavailability
   - Consider for all refractory cases on oral therapy

2. **Injectable to oral** (rare indication):
   - Severe injection site reactions
   - Lipomas or granulomas forming
   - Client unable to inject

3. **Change GS-441524 brand/source:**
   - If quality concerns
   - Anecdotal reports of response variation
   - Difficult to verify concentration accuracy

### Protocol 3: Combination Antiviral Therapy

**Note:** Limited published evidence; based primarily on case reports and theoretical benefits

**GS-441524 + Remdesivir:**

- **Rationale:**
  - Different pharmacokinetics
  - Potentially synergistic
  - Some anecdotal success in refractory cases

- **Dosing (reported in literature/case reports):**
  - GS-441524: Continue at current dose
  - Remdesivir: Variable protocols reported

- **Challenges:**
  - Remdesivir availability limited
  - Cost prohibitive for many clients
  - Requires IV administration initially
  - Limited outcome data

- **Evidence quality:** Low (case reports only)

**GS-441524 + Interferon:**

- **Polyprenyl Immunostimulant (PI):**
  - Immunomodulator with theoretical benefits
  - Oral administration
  - Well-tolerated

- **Feline interferon omega:**
  - Licensed in some countries (not US)
  - Anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory
  - Subcutaneous administration

- **Evidence:** Mixed; some case reports show benefit, others no difference

### Protocol 4: Adjunctive Therapies

**Corticosteroids:**

**Controversy:** Some advocate for, others against

**Arguments FOR use:**
- FIP pathology driven by inflammation
- May reduce organ damage
- Can improve appetite and quality of life
- Some case reports of improved outcomes

**Arguments AGAINST use:**
- Immunosuppression may worsen viral replication
- May mask clinical signs of progression
- Historical failure of steroids as monotherapy
- Theoretical concern about interfering with antiviral effectiveness

**Current approach (if used):**
- Low to moderate doses only
- Prednisolone: 0.5-1 mg/kg q12-24h initially, taper to lowest effective dose
- Use for cats with severe inflammation/symptoms despite antivirals
- Taper off as clinical signs improve
- Not recommended as first-line or long-term

**Other anti-inflammatory options:**
- **Maropitant:** For nausea, may have anti-inflammatory properties
- **NSAIDs:** Generally avoided (risk of GI ulceration, renal compromise)

**Supportive care:**

- **Appetite stimulants:**
  - Mirtazapine: 1.88-3.75 mg per cat q48-72h
  - Maropitant: 1-2 mg/kg q24h
  - Capromorelin: 2 mg/kg q24h

- **Nutritional support:**
  - High-calorie diets
  - Feeding tubes if needed (esophagostomy)
  - Omega-3 fatty acids

- **Fluid therapy:**
  - Subcutaneous if dehydrated
  - IV if severe dehydration or not tolerating SC

- **Pain management:**
  - Buprenorphine: 0.01-0.03 mg/kg q8-12h
  - Gabapentin: 5-10 mg/kg q8-12h

- **Drain effusions if impairing respiration:**
  - Therapeutic abdominocentesis/thoracentesis
  - May need repeated drainage in refractory cases

### Protocol 5: Extended Treatment Duration

**Indications:**
- Slow but steady improvement
- Neurological or ocular involvement
- Bloodwork normalizing slowly
- Clinical signs improving but not resolved

**Approach:**
- Continue treatment beyond standard 12-16 weeks
- Some cats require 20-24 weeks or longer
- Monitor bloodwork monthly
- Continue until:
  - Complete clinical resolution for 4+ weeks
  - A:G ratio normalized
  - All inflammatory markers normal
  - Then taper if protocol calls for it

**Evidence:**
- Case reports of cats requiring extended treatment
- Neurological and ocular cases often need longer
- No established maximum duration

## Troubleshooting Specific Scenarios

### Scenario 1: No Response After 4 Weeks

**Systematic approach:**

1. ✅ **Verify diagnosis** (Step 1)
2. ✅ **Confirm adequate dosing** (Step 2)
3. ✅ **Check medication quality** (Step 2)
4. ✅ **Assess compliance** (Step 3)
5. → **If all adequate:** Escalate dose by 50%
6. → **If oral medication:** Switch to injectable
7. → **Re-evaluate after 2 weeks:**
   - Improvement → Continue
   - No improvement → Consider stopping or trying combination therapy
   - Worsening → Reconsider diagnosis

**Client discussion points:**
- Acknowledge treatment isn't working as hoped
- Review options: dose increase, formulation change, combination therapy
- Discuss realistic prognosis with current approach
- Financial considerations for extended/intensified treatment
- Quality of life assessment
- Alternative of palliative care or euthanasia

### Scenario 2: Partial Response Then Plateau

**Definition:** Improvement in some parameters but incomplete response

**Common presentation:**
- Appetite and energy improved
- Fever resolved
- But: Effusion persists, weight not increasing, bloodwork not normalizing

**Approach:**

1. **Assess weight gain:**
   - Is dose being adjusted for weight gain?
   - Many "plateaus" are actually underdosing due to weight increase

2. **If dose appropriate for current weight:**
   - Escalate by 25%
   - Re-evaluate in 2-3 weeks

3. **Consider switching formulation** if on oral
4. **Evaluate for concurrent disease**
5. **Extend treatment duration** - some cats are slow responders

### Scenario 3: Initial Response Then Deterioration

**Most concerning pattern** - suggests:
- Development of viral resistance (theoretical, not proven)
- Inadequate dosing
- Concurrent disease emerging
- Misdiagnosis

**Immediate actions:**

1. **Verify continued compliance**
2. **Check current weight and recalculate dose**
3. **Increase dose by 50%**
4. **Switch to injectable if using oral**
5. **Rule out concurrent infections:**
   - Bacterial culture of effusion
   - Broad-spectrum antibiotic trial
   - FeLV/FIV testing if not done
6. **Consider advanced imaging** (CT/MRI if neurological)
7. **Serious discussion about prognosis**

### Scenario 4: Injection Site Reactions Limiting Treatment

**Common problem:** Granulomas, pain, abscessation at injection sites

**Solutions:**

1. **Optimize injection technique:**
   - Ensure SC (not IM or intradermal)
   - Rotate sites consistently
   - Warm medication to room temp
   - Inject slowly

2. **Dilute medication if concentrated:**
   - Some formulations are painful due to high concentration
   - Dilution may reduce reactions (verify with source)

3. **Switch to oral formulation** if injectable not tolerated
   - Accept possibly lower bioavailability
   - Better than inconsistent dosing

4. **Manage existing reactions:**
   - Warm compresses
   - Avoid affected areas
   - Consider NSAIDs if severe (carefully)
   - Rarely: surgical excision of large granulomas

## When to Consider Stopping Treatment

### Indicators Treatment is Failing

**After 6-8 weeks of optimized treatment:**

- No clinical improvement whatsoever
- Progressive organ failure
- Worsening quality of life
- Severe adverse effects
- Client unable to continue (financial/emotional/practical)

**Quality of life assessment:**

Consider euthanasia if:
- Cat is suffering (pain, severe dyspnea, uncontrolled seizures)
- No appetite despite interventions
- Withdrawn, hiding, not interacting
- Deteriorating despite maximum therapy
- Quality of life is poor

**Client discussion:**

- Be honest about prognosis
- No judgment about stopping treatment
- Frame euthanasia as humane choice if quality of life poor
- Some cases are genuinely refractory
- Palliative care option if not ready for euthanasia

---

## Relapse Management

### Post-Treatment Relapse

**Incidence:** 5-10% of successfully treated cats relapse

**Typical timeframe:** 3-6 months after stopping treatment (range: 2 weeks to >1 year)

**Clinical presentation:**
- May mirror original disease
- May present differently
- Often less severe than initial episode

**Management approach:**

1. **Confirm relapse vs. new disease**
2. **Restart treatment at previous effective dose** (or higher)
3. **Treat for longer duration:** 16-24 weeks minimum
4. **Consider indefinite or extended maintenance therapy** after second cure
5. **Prognosis:** Most relapses respond to retreatment (80-85% success)

### Relapse During Treatment

**More concerning:** Suggests resistance or inadequate therapy

**Management:**
1. **Immediate dose escalation** (50-100%)
2. **Verify medication quality**
3. **Consider combination therapy**
4. **Extend treatment duration significantly**
5. **Prognosis guarded** but some cats still respond

## Special Populations

### Neurological FIP - Refractory Cases

**Challenges:**
- Blood-brain barrier limits drug penetration
- Higher doses required
- Response often slower
- Permanent damage may occur

**Approach:**
- Doses up to 15-20 mg/kg reported in literature
- Consider combination therapy earlier
- CT/MRI to assess extent of CNS damage
- Extended treatment duration (20-24+ weeks)
- Some deficits may be permanent even with viral clearance

### Ocular FIP - Refractory Cases

**Challenges:**
- Intraocular penetration variable
- Vision loss may be irreversible
- Often concurrent with systemic FIP

**Approach:**
- Ensure systemic disease controlled first
- Higher doses (8-10 mg/kg minimum)
- Extended treatment (16-20+ weeks)
- Consider topical or subconjunctival therapy (limited evidence)
- Ophthalmology referral for assessment

### FeLV/FIV Co-infected Cats

**Prognosis significantly worsened** by retroviral co-infection

**Challenges:**
- Immunocompromise limits viral clearance
- Concurrent opportunistic infections
- Shortened lifespan even if FIP controlled

**Approach:**
- Higher doses may be needed
- Aggressive supportive care
- Management of concurrent infections
- Realistic discussion with owners about prognosis
- Some cats still achieve temporary or long-term remission

## Case Examples

### Case 1: Successful Dose Escalation

**Signalment:** 8-month-old DSH, wet FIP
**Initial treatment:** 6 mg/kg GS-441524 injectable
**Response:** Appetite improved, fever resolved, but effusion persisted at 4 weeks
**Intervention:** Dose increased to 9 mg/kg
**Outcome:** Effusion resolved within 2 weeks, completed 14-week course successfully, no relapse at 1 year

**Lesson:** Some cats need higher than standard doses

### Case 2: Formulation Switch Success

**Signalment:** 1-year-old Ragdoll, dry FIP with ocular involvement
**Initial treatment:** 8 mg/kg GS-441524 oral
**Response:** Minimal improvement after 4 weeks
**Intervention:** Switched to injectable, same dose
**Outcome:** Rapid improvement within 1 week, completed 16-week course, vision partially restored

**Lesson:** Injectable formulation more reliable for some cats

### Case 3: Refractory Case - Diagnosis Revised

**Signalment:** 6-year-old cat, presumed neurological FIP
**Treatment:** 12 mg/kg GS-441524, no response after 6 weeks
**Re-evaluation:** MRI revealed mass lesion; biopsy confirmed lymphoma
**Outcome:** Switched to chemotherapy; moderate response

**Lesson:** Always reconsider diagnosis in non-responders
