## Diagnostic Approach to Differential Diagnosis

### Step 1: Signalment Assessment

**Age:**
- <2 years: FIP more likely
- >5 years: Neoplasia, pancreatitis, other chronic diseases more likely

**Lifestyle:**
- Indoor only: FIP, lymphoma, congenital conditions
- Outdoor access: Infectious diseases (toxoplasmosis, mycobacteria, FIV)
- Multi-cat household: FIP risk increased
- Fighting history: Retrovirus, abscesses, trauma

**Breed:**
- Pedigree: FIP risk increased (breed-specific risks)

### Step 2: Clinical Pattern Recognition

**Effusive Disease Pattern:**
- FIP: Low cell count, high protein, non-degenerative cells
- Pyothorax/peritonitis: High cell count, septic, degenerative cells
- CHF: Low protein, no fever, cardiac signs
- Neoplasia: Neoplastic cells on cytology

**Neurological Pattern:**
- FIP: Multifocal, slowly progressive, young cat
- Toxoplasmosis: Responds to clindamycin, dietary history
- Trauma: Acute onset, history
- Thiamine deficiency: Dietary history, rapid response to thiamine

**Ocular Pattern:**
- FIP: Anterior uveitis, retinal changes, young cat
- Toxoplasmosis: Chorioretinitis, responds to clindamycin
- Lymphoma: Neoplastic cells
- Bartonella: Uveitis, flea exposure

### Step 3: Laboratory Differentiation

**CBC Patterns:**
- FIP: Non-regenerative anemia, lymphopenia, mild neutrophilia
- Haemoplasmosis: Regenerative anemia
- Sepsis: Marked neutrophilia with left shift
- Lymphoma: May have circulating abnormal lymphocytes

**Chemistry Patterns:**
- FIP: High globulin, low A:G, hyperbilirubinaemia, mild liver enzymes
- Cholangiohepatitis: Marked elevation ALT/ALP/GGT
- Pancreatitis: Elevated fPLI
- Renal disease: High BUN/creatinine

**Effusion Analysis:**
- FIP: High protein (>35 g/L), low cells (<5×10⁹/L), Rivalta +
- Septic: High cells, degenerative, bacteria
- CHF: Low protein (<25 g/L), low cells
- Neoplastic: Neoplastic cells present

### Step 4: Specific Testing

**Infectious Disease Testing:**
- FCoV: PCR, immunostaining (for FIP confirmation)
- Toxoplasma: Serology, PCR
- Mycobacteria: Ziehl-Neelsen, PCR, culture
- FeLV/FIV: Serology
- Cryptococcus: Antigen test
- Bartonella: Serology, PCR

**Imaging:**
- Ultrasonography: Organ changes, effusions, masses
- Radiography: Masses, cardiomegaly, pulmonary patterns
- CT/MRI: Detailed CNS evaluation, masses
- Echocardiography: Cardiac disease

**Tissue Sampling:**
- Cytology: FNA of organs, effusions
- Histopathology: Definitive for many conditions
- Immunohistochemistry: FCoV, lymphoma phenotyping

## Common Diagnostic Pitfalls

### Assuming Single Disease

**Reality:** Cats can have concurrent diseases
- FeLV + Lymphoma
- FIP + Toxoplasmosis
- FIV + Various opportunistic infections

**Approach:** Consider all possibilities, test systematically

### Over-relying on Antibody Tests

**FCoV antibodies:**
- Present in many healthy cats
- Not diagnostic of FIP
- Only indicates exposure

**Approach:** Use appropriate confirmatory tests (PCR with high loads, immunostaining, histopathology)

### Premature Diagnostic Closure

**Risk:** Accepting first diagnosis without ruling out alternatives

**Approach:**
- Systematic differential diagnosis list
- Rule out most likely alternatives
- Confirm FIP with appropriate testing

### Missing Concurrent Diseases

**Risk:** Stopping investigation after finding one disease

**Approach:**
- Consider FeLV/FIV predisposing to other infections
- Multiple infectious agents possible
- Immune compromise enables opportunistic infections

## Summary Algorithm

1. **Assess Signalment:** Age, lifestyle, breed → Narrow differentials

2. **Pattern Recognition:** Effusive, neurological, ocular, systemic → Likely categories

3. **Laboratory Testing:** CBC, chemistry, effusion analysis → Further narrow

4. **Specific Tests:** Based on pattern → Confirm or rule out

5. **Tissue Diagnosis:** When needed → Definitive diagnosis

6. **Treatment Trial:** When appropriate → Diagnostic and therapeutic

## Key Take-Home Points

1. **Age is critical**: Young cats = FIP more likely; Older cats = neoplasia, chronic diseases

2. **Lifestyle matters**: Outdoor = infectious diseases; Indoor = FIP, genetic/congenital

3. **Effusion analysis is key**: Cell count and protein content differentiate major categories

4. **FIP is a diagnosis of preponderance**: Requires multiple supporting findings

5. **Rule out treatable diseases first**: Many differentials are curable (toxoplasmosis, bacterial infections)

6. **Consider concurrent diseases**: Especially in immunocompromised cats

7. **Use systematic approach**: Don't skip steps in diagnostic workup

8. **Confirm FIP definitively when possible**: Histopathology + immunohistochemistry = gold standard
