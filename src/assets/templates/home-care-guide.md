## Injection Technique

### Step 1: Prepare Your Supplies

1. **Wash your hands thoroughly** with soap and water
2. **Gather all supplies** on a clean surface
3. **Calculate dose:** Verify the correct volume for your cat's current weight
4. **Draw up medication:**
   - Remove cap from vial
   - Insert needle through rubber stopper
   - Pull back plunger to draw correct amount
   - Check for air bubbles - tap syringe and push out if present
   - Verify correct dose volume

### Step 2: Prepare Your Cat

**Create a calm environment:**

- Choose a quiet area with good lighting
- Have a helper if possible (especially for first few injections)
- Use treats, catnip, or favorite toys as distraction
- Consider timing injection before meals or play time

**Position your cat:**

- Most cats do best sitting or standing on a table
- Some prefer being held in lap or on floor
- Use a towel to gently wrap if cat is squirmy (leave injection site exposed)
- Stay calm - cats sense your anxiety

### Step 3: Select Injection Site

**Best locations for subcutaneous injections:**

1. **Scruff of neck** (between shoulder blades)
2. **Shoulder blade area** (either side)
3. **Hip area** (either side)
4. **Lateral chest wall** (either side)

**Important rotation principles:**

- **Never use same spot two days in a row**
- **Rotate among 4-6 different sites**
- **Track rotation in treatment log**
- **Avoid areas that are:**
  - Sore, red, or swollen from previous injections
  - Over bony areas
  - Near the spine

**Why rotation matters:**

- Prevents irritation and scarring
- Reduces discomfort
- Improves medication absorption
- Minimizes local reactions

### Step 4: Administer the Injection

1. **Create a "tent" with the skin:**
   - Gently grasp loose skin between thumb and fingers
   - Lift upward to create a pocket
   - The skin should form an inverted V

2. **Insert the needle:**
   - Hold syringe like a dart
   - Insert needle at 45-degree angle into the skin tent
   - Insert quickly and smoothly in one motion
   - **Pull back slightly on plunger** - if you see blood, remove needle and try a different spot

3. **Inject the medication:**
   - Push plunger smoothly and steadily
   - Don't rush - complete injection over 3-5 seconds
   - Larger volumes may take longer

4. **Remove needle and complete:**
   - Withdraw needle quickly in one smooth motion
   - Release skin tent
   - Gently massage injection site for a few seconds (optional)
   - **Do not rub vigorously**

5. **Reward your cat immediately:**
   - Offer favorite treats
   - Provide praise and affection
   - Play or cuddle if cat is receptive

### Step 5: Dispose of Supplies Safely

- **Never recap needles** - risk of needle stick
- Immediately place used syringe and needle in sharps container
- Keep sharps container out of reach of children and pets
- When full, seal container and dispose according to local regulations
- Many pharmacies and veterinary clinics accept sharps containers

## Safety Precautions

### For You (Human Safety)

- **Avoid needle sticks:** Never recap needles

- **Wear gloves if desired** (especially if you have cuts on hands)
- **Pregnant women:** Consult your physician before handling antiviral medications
- **Keep medication away from children**

### For Your Cat

- **Watch for local reactions:**
  - Mild: Small bump at injection site (normal, resolves in hours)
  - Moderate: Swelling, tenderness (may need site rotation adjustment)
  - Severe: Significant swelling, heat, pain, discharge (call veterinarian)
- **Monitor for allergic reactions:**
  - Facial swelling
  - Difficulty breathing
  - Vomiting immediately after injection
  - Collapse or weakness
  - **These are rare but require immediate veterinary attention**

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### "My cat won't stay still"

**Solutions:**
- Have a helper gently restrain
- Use a towel wrap (burrito method)
- Time injection when cat is sleepy or relaxed
- Try immediately after waking or before meals
- Consider anxiety-reducing techniques (Feliway spray, calming treats)
- Ask your veterinarian about pre-injection sedation if truly impossible

### "I see medication leaking out after injection"

**This is common and usually not concerning:**
- A few drops of leakage is normal
- Don't attempt to re-inject the leaked amount
- Make sure you're creating a proper skin tent
- Hold skin tent for 3-5 seconds after injection
- Inject more slowly

### "The injection seems painful"

**To reduce discomfort:**
- Ensure medication is room temperature (not cold)
- Inject slowly and steadily (not too fast)
- Use smaller needles if possible (ask veterinarian)
- Rotate injection sites consistently
- Consider applying warm compress before injection
- Ask veterinarian about pain management options

### "I forgot a dose"

**If you miss a dose:**
- **Give as soon as you remember** if less than 12 hours late
- **If more than 12 hours late:** Skip missed dose and give next scheduled dose
- **Never double up doses**
- **Note missed dose in treatment log**
- **Contact veterinarian if you miss multiple doses**

### "I'm not sure if the injection went in"

**Signs of successful injection:**
- Needle penetrated skin (you felt it go through)
- Syringe plunger pushed completely
- No large puddle of medication on fur
- Small bump may be visible/palpable at injection site

**If truly unsure:**
- Do NOT give second injection
- Note uncertainty in treatment log
- Contact veterinarian for guidance
- Resume normal schedule with next dose

## Monitoring Your Cat During Treatment

### When to Call Your Veterinarian

**Call immediately if:**
- Difficulty breathing or rapid breathing
- Severe lethargy or collapse
- Vomiting or diarrhea (severe or bloody)
- Not eating for 24+ hours
- Significant worsening of symptoms
- Severe swelling at injection site
- Signs of allergic reaction

**Call within 24 hours if:**
